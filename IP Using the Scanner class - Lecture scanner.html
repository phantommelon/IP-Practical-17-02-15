<center><h1>IP: Using the Scanner class - 
Lecture scanner</h1></center>

The <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/index.html?java/util/Scanner.html">Scanner</a> class, as discussed in the <a href="https://community.dur.ac.uk/s.p.bradley/teaching/IP/lecture_calculator1">lecture about the calculator</a> allows interactive input from the keyboard. In this practical you will practice using the Scanner class within an application.

<ol>
<li>Take one of the programs you have written before and adapt it so that you can use it with a text-based user interface. For example, you could take the company scenario and add a menu-based interface where users can 
<ul>  
<li>Add/remove people of different types</li>
<li>Record sales and overtime</li>
<li>Pay a share divided</li>
<li>Do a monthly or weekly payroll</li>
</ul>
It doesnâ€™t have to be the company scenario, it can be anything you like as long as you are using text input, preferably with a Scanner.
</li>

<li>
When writing a menu-based system take care not to have too much code duplication: cutting and pasting is very tempting in the short term but very costly in the medium term. Use data structures, methods and loops to represent and render your menus.
</li>

<li>
Extend the blues-writing program from the previous practical to ask interactively for help in constructing a blues song. For instance your program could choose a bluesy word or phrase at random from examples suggested, and then ask the user to provide a word or phrase that rhymes. Or you could get the user to provide an appropriate first line and then construct a song based on that, asking for extra words as they are required.
</li>

</ol>
